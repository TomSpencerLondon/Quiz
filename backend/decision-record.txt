## Decision Record

### Options for getting a Question object
- Inject QuestionRepository directly into the QuizController (Best of all choices)
- Inject QuestionRepository into QuizSessionService: NOT REALLY
- Not a good choice: QuizSession doesn't have much to do with Question (directly)
- Inject into ResponseView: NO (Can't inject into a static method, prefer passing in as parameter)
